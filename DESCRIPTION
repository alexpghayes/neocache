Description: Facilitates robust sampling of the Twitter graph by saving
    data about observed nodes into a data cache. Requests for new nodes
    are smart and do not waste API requests on nodes already in the cache.
    The cache can then be exported to a number of data structures more
    appropriate for network analysis. Automatically manages multiple
    tokens to speed up sampling with staying with API rate limits.
