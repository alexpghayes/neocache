\title{Get (cached) information about Twitter users}
\usage{
nc_lookup_users(
  users,
  cache_name,
  token = NULL,
  retryonratelimit = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{users}{User id or screen name of target user.}

\item{cache_name}{the name of the cache and associated Docker container}

\item{token}{Expert use only. Use this to override authentication for
a single API call. In most cases you are better off changing the
default for all calls. See \code{\link[rtweet:auth_as]{auth_as()}} for details.}

\item{retryonratelimit}{If \code{TRUE}, and a rate limit is exhausted, will wait
until it refreshes. Most Twitter rate limits refresh every 15 minutes.
If \code{FALSE}, and the rate limit is exceeded, the function will terminate
early with a warning; you'll still get back all results received up to
that point. The default value, \code{NULL}, consults the option
\code{rtweet.retryonratelimit} so that you can globally set it to \code{TRUE},
if desired.

If you expect a query to take hours or days to perform, you should not
rely soley on \code{retryonratelimit} because it does not handle other common
failure modes like temporarily losing your internet connection.}

\item{verbose}{Show progress bars and other messages indicating current
progress?}
}
\value{
A tibble where each row corresponds to a User and each column
to one of the User properties. If a user cannot be sampled, should
return nothing for that user. If no users can be sampled, should
return an empty tibble with appropriate columns.
}
\description{
Looks up information pertaining to a vector of provided users. Retrieves
cached data for users who have already been looked up, and fetches new
data for users who have not bee looked up yet from the Twitter API.
}
